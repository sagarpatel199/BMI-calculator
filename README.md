BMI Calculator Portfolio Project

This project showcases the development of a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator.
The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface where users can input their height and weight to calculate their BMI. 
The application dynamically calculates the BMI based on the user's input and provides an immediate result along with a corresponding category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese). 
The project demonstrates proficiency in front-end development, including HTML form creation, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic for BMI calculation.
